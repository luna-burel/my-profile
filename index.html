			    		<p>WELCOME TO MY PROFILE!🥳</br>
Hello ! My name is Luna Burel. I was born and raised in France 🇫🇷. I did not really lead an international life by living in France, but I’ve constantly visited many places around the world throughout my vacations, Kenya and Bali being one of my favorite places. That’s probably why I am deeply curious and open-minded. I'm currently living in Cergy, were I'm studying a degree in Business Administration at ESSEC Business School.</p>

						<h2>✈️TRAVEL✈️</h2>
						<p>
						I love traveling because it is an incredibly enriching experience that can broaden our horizons, challenge our perspectives, and provide us with a greater understanding of the world and its diverse cultures. It allows us to explore different ways of life, beliefs, and customs, and exposes us to new ideas, languages, and cuisines.
</br></br>
In my opinion, one of the most significant benefits of travel is that it can break down cultural barriers and foster empathy and understanding among people from different backgrounds. By immersing

By immersing myself in unfamiliar environments, I can learn to appreciate and respect the diversity of the world, and gain a greater sense of compassion and connection with others.
</br></br>
I've had the chance to travel to more than a dozen countries and I think this is a real asset for me.

						<h2>🎶MUSIC🎶</h2>
						<p>
							Playing music is an activity which has helped me express my feelings and let out everything that goes into my mind. I find it so satisfying to just take one of my instruments (piano or transverse flute) and start playing and experimenting with ideas that come into my mind. Also, I believe playing music has helped me relax and think of other things in times of stress.
</br></br>
I used to playing music very often when I was little, but once I began my studies I took less time to do it. However, I still play from time to time as a form of therapy, satisfaction and self-expression. My favorite musics to play are River Flows In You of Yiruma and Sonata of Vivaldi.

						<h2>🏅SPORT🏅</h2>
						<p>
							I'm a very active and enthusiastic girl, so sports make part of my dialy life. I have done many sports throughout my whole life apart from tennis. These include horse riding, swimming, golf, handball, athletics, skiing, swimming, etc. There's not a single sport so far, out of these, that I haven't enjoyed.
</br></br>
I believe sports have contributed a lot to my personal growth and character. They've increased my self-esteem, improved my social skills and leadership abilities, my resilience and developed a positive attitude towards hard moments. Sports have taught me that failing is completely normal when learning something new, to respect the opponents and Fairplay among many other things.
</br></br>
Overall, without sports, I wouldn't have become who I currently am; I feel they're part of my personality.
